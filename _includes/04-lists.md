### I love to:
* Spend time with my family
* Watch movies
* Read books
  * Tech Books (Programming, and any other related tech stuff)
  * Self-Improvement Books
  * Fiction and Non-fiction
  * Really just about anything that will keep my attention past the first chapter
* I love to make things (3D printing, woodworking, sewing, electronics[My newest and most interesting hobby])
